# New York Times Best Sellers

## Goal

To predict a New York Times Best Sellers using natural language processing and publishing features.

## Data

The initial dataset is from Goodreads list of Goodreads choice awards of best fiction books in 2016, 2017, 2018 and list of NYT notable books from 2016, 2017, and 2018.

## EDA

The books were categorized as a binary on the New York Times Best Seller list or not. 
Goodreads is user driven, with metadata about the books, a short description, and ratings and comments from users. The mean rating for books on the Best Seller list is slightly lower than those not on the list.
